# Railway Management System

This project attempts to create a database management system to supervise, control and use the various parts of the national railway system.
The project will allow a user to use the system in both administrative and non-administrative roles. As an administrator, the user will be able to take control of the management of stations and trains. As a customer, the system will provide an interface to manage seat bookings.

## Installation

Any C++ compiler can be used to compile the ``main.cpp`` file. Note that there are additional files in the home directory and in the ``src`` subfolder that also need to be compiled. Header files for these can be found in the home directory and include subfolder respectively.

## Usage

A basic user interface has been provided that should make the usage of the program simple to understand. Note that data will be stored in external ``.txt`` and ``.dat`` files with **NO PROTECTION**. This project is meant to be a starting point for larger programs, not a complete program in and of itself.

## Contributing

This project is no longer under active development. Contributions are not being accepted.
