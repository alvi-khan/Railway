# Railway Management System

This project will attempt to create a system that allows users to book train tickets. There will be predefined information regarding the trains, the seats available, the route the train will follow, the stations it will pass through and the specific time it will be stopped at the stations. The information will be presented to the user in stages, depending on the departure and arrival locations given by the user, and will be used to book a seat on their chosen train for them.
